Containerization Technology!

This is new way to manage an organize your software applications. 

## Without Containerization
Software applications are installed on file system of your device (computer, andriod phone, raspberry pi board). Virtualization technology allows for more efficient utilization of physical computer hardware (processor, memory, storage). 

Often it is complex process to install applications and their dependancies. Beginners may face difficulties if something goes wrong during installation.  

## With Containerization

In logistics, containers hide what's inside and can easily be transported becuase the outside is standardized. 

In Software, Container packages up software code and its dependancies into Standardized Units so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. Containers consits of prefabricated applications. 

Best Container tools that are available in the market are as follows:
* Docker
* LXC
* Google Kubernetes Engine
* RedHat openShift

### Container Orchestration

Container Orchestration simply refers to processes used to manage containers and to automate the management of containers

Best Container Orchestration tools that are available in the market are as follows:
* Kubernetes
